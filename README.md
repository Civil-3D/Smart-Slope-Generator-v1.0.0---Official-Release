Smart Slope Generator (AutoCAD / Civil 3D) ⛰️
A highly dynamic, UI-driven plugin for AutoCAD and Civil 3D designed to generate professional slope patterns, hatches, and Tapered lines (triangles) with ease. Created to streamline workflows for Civil Engineers and infrastructure designers.

✨ Key Features
Dynamic Visual JIG: Real-time preview of slope lines as you move your mouse, ensuring perfect placement before clicking.

Elastic & Proportional Distribution: Smart algorithm distributes lines proportionally, preventing crossing or overlapping on sharp internal corners or steep terrain.

Multiple Professional Styles:

Fixed Length: Standard uniform patterns.

Long / 1 Short: Classic slope representation.

Long / 2 Shorts: European standard style.

Advanced Ending Types: Professional markers for short lines, including Circles and T-Shape Ticks.

Tapered Triangles: Option to draw long slope lines as solid Civil 3D style triangles for clean master plans.

Auto Cut/Fill Detection: Automatically senses elevation (Z-axis) differences between Crest and Toe to orient the pattern correctly downwards.

Settings Persistence: Remembers your last-used layers, colors, and styles for your next session.

Wipeout Background: Generates a background hatch mask to maintain clarity over complex underlying topography.

🚀 Installation
Option 1: MSI Installer (Recommended)
Download the latest SmartSlopeInstaller.msi from the Releases section.

Run the installer. It will automatically place the plugin in the Autodesk ApplicationPlugins folder.

Restart AutoCAD or Civil 3D. The command will be ready to use!

Option 2: Manual Load (Portable)
Download the Draw_Slopes.dll file.

In AutoCAD / Civil 3D, type the NETLOAD command.

Select the downloaded .dll file.

🛠️ Usage
Type the command DRAWSLOPE in the command line.

Configure your preferred settings (Step, Ratio, Style, Layer, Colors) in the modern UI window.

Click Draw Slope.

Select the Top Line (Crest).

Select the Bottom Line (Toe).

Use the dynamic JIG to select a segment or draw along the entire length of the lines.

📝 Planned Updates
Auto-Coloring: Automated color separation based on Cut and Fill values.

Slope Labeling: Automatic text labeling for gradients (e.g., 1:1.5).
